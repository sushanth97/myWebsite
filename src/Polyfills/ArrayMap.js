        <div>
            <p>We will start with little introduction to array Map.</p>
            <h3>Array Map</h3>
            <p>Map is a function used to perform some operations on each item in an array and return the modified output to form a new array.</p>
            <h5>Lets see examples for Map</h5>
            <p>Hope the above definition and example is clear. So we will start creating polyfill for Array Map.</p>
            <h5>So what is Polyfill?</h5>
            <p>Browsers will provide the inbuild fuctions like map. But what if Browsers didn't provide those inbuild functions?. So polyfills is like we will build this inbuild functions but with our own logic.</p>
        </div>
